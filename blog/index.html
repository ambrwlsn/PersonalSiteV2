                <h5>20.01.17</h5>Hi, my name is Amber and I like words. Words like cognizant, parallel, and stupefy. English is my native language and I enjoy its nuances. I also enjoy other languages, especially German. I can't explain where my love of language came from. I didn't enjoy English classes at school and I took German classes on a whim. Playing with language makes me happy, no matter which one it is. Reeling off long, complicated sentences is fun - even more so when you have a friend to bounce them back at you. Is nothing in this world free? Words seem to be.
